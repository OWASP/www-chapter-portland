## Welcome

This is the website of the Portland, Oregon OWASP Chapter.

Our chapter is dedicated to the application security and information security of the Pacific Northwest.  Above are tabs to various elements of our chapter activity.  We host monthly chapter meetings with presentations from regional security practitioners, and we collaborate with other chapters in the Pacific Northwest to produce an annual appsec conference called OWASP AppSec Days Pacific Northwest. The conference has been running for three years. In 2023 it was held in Portland. In 2024 it will be in Vancouver, BC.
