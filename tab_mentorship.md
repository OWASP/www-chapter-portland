# Mentorship

## What It Is

We're in the business of helping people grow. Whether you are a beginner, and expert, or somewhere in between, we want to help you develop as a professional. Our mentorship program runs for 6 months. We work to pair you with someone who has experience or is interest in the same area you are looking to mentor or be mentored. It's about relationships, hands on keyboards, questions, advice. A lot of the program is what you make out of the relationship we seed you with. 

## How to Get Involved

If you are interested in finding a mentor or being a mentor, please contact one of our leaders in our chapter via email.

## Resources to Help

Here is our [resource guide](https://owasp-pdx.gitbook.io/owasp-pdx-mentorship-resources/) for our mentorship program. It is very much a work in progress (and we would love your help if you want to throw some people hours at it).
