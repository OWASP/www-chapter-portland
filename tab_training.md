| OWASP Portland 2021 Training Day |
| --- |
| This year's Training Day will be on Wednesday October 13. The fully remote event will include a morning keynote, two morning sessions, several lunch panels, two afternoon sessions, and an all-day CTF. Full details are not quite ready for release, but we have a great keynote speaker, a robust lunch panel to answer questions about getting into and growing your career in application/information security, and several amazing training sessions lined up. Thanks as well to our many sponsors. The registration will be up soon. Keep an eye out as the spots available are limited and if last go around was any guide they'll probably sell out in the first 48 hours. |
