# Training Day
For the fifth year in a row, the Portland OWASP chapter is proud to host our information security training day! This will be an excellent opportunity for the local Portland security community to receive top quality information security and application security training for prices far lower than normally offered. It's also a great chance to network with other local infosec and appsec enthusiasts and meet those who share your interests.

The 5th annual OWASP Portland 2020 Training Day date will be on September 23, 2020.
